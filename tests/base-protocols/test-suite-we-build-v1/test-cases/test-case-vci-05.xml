        <gitb:version>1.0</gitb:version>
        <gitb:description>Test integration of Wallet with WE BUILD reference implementation.
            Authorization code flow:
            - The endpoint initiates the OAuth2 authorization code flow with PKCE:
            Returns a credential offer with authorization_code grant
            Wallet calls /authorize
            Wallet exchanges code at /token_endpoint
            Wallet requests credential at /credential
            Ensures mDL issuance pairs with mDL verifier routes (routes/verify/mdlRoutes.js).
            issue an ISO 18013-5 mDL credential (mso_mdoc format)
            Uses CBOR encoding with COSE Sign1 signing
            When signatureType=x509, uses X.509 certificate for signing
