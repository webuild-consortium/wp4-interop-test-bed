        <gitb:name>Test Case VP-003: WE BUILD - DCQL-based Verifiable Presentation request for
            urn:eu.europa.ec.eudi:pid:1 with family_name claim
        </gitb:name>
        <gitb:version>1.0</gitb:version>
        <gitb:description>Test integration of Wallet with WE BUILD reference implementation.
            DCQL-based Verifiable Presentation request (urn:eu.europa.ec.eudi:pid:1 with family_name claim) using x509
            client_id_scheme with direct_post response mode and GET method for request URI.
            . The wallet fetches the VP request JWT via GET (instead of POST) from the request_uri endpoint.
            Wallet responds with VP token via POST to /direct_post/{sessionId}.
            The verifier performs comprehensive verification including: (1) State parameter validation - ensures state
            matches the session to prevent replay attacks; (2) Nonce verification - validates nonce from key-binding JWT
            (for SD-JWT) or VP token payload matches the challenge nonce; (3) Key-binding JWT verification - for SD-JWT
            credentials, extracts and validates the key-binding JWT signature, verifies audience (aud) matches
            verifier's client_id, and ensures the key-binding JWT contains the required nonce; (4) Credential signature
            verification - validates issuer signatures on SD-JWT or JWT VC credentials using issuer JWKS or x5c
            certificates; (5) Holder binding verification - verifies the key-binding JWT public key (from cnf.jwk)
            matches the wallet's presentation key, ensuring proof of possession; (6) Selective disclosure validation -
            ensures only requested claims (per DCQL query) are disclosed; (7) Credential type validation - verifies
            presented credentials match requested types (vct/doctype); (8) Request URI method - wallet fetches VP
            request using GET method (no request_uri_method=post parameter in the OpenID4VP URL
