This is where the Testing Group publishes documentation and general information.

## ITB documentation
**User guide**  
https://github.com/webuild-consortium/wp4-interop-test-bed/blob/main/docs/user-guide-interoperability-test-bed.md  
This guide explains how issuers, verifiers, and wallet providers onboard the EUDI Wallet Interoperability Test Bed (ITB), run reference tests, collect evidence, and request compliance sign-off. It focuses on operational steps and minimal REST contracts; it does not describe the internal ITB architecture.

**Reference Implementation Specification**
https://github.com/webuild-consortium/wp4-interop-test-bed/blob/main/docs/reference-implementation-interoperability-test-bed.md
This reference implementation specification is a guide for all wallet SW vendors to provide their implementation as a reference implementation with the ITB.
It also contains a high-level overview of the ITB architecture.
