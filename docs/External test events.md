# CSC Plugtest Event - March 2026 - Bucharest
The Cloud Signature Consortium (CSC) will host an **in-person** Plugtest Event on 17/18 March in Bucharest.
The main goal is to validate CSC API v2.2 interoperability at scale. Invitations are specifically extended to all participants in both WE BUILD and Aptitude.

CSC provides a reference wallet implementation in the POTENTIAL Playground sandbox. You can test against that, or bring your own wallet implementation.
The EC will be present and support the test cases.
