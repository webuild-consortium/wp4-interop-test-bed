# External test environments 
This document lists the external test environments that we are aware of.
Please keep in mind that information is being updated continuously. If you have new information, please update this information or inform the Testing Group in WP4.

We expect most of these environments to have a specific trust infrastructural setup. This means that you probably need to adapt your implementations to meet the requirements set out by them to engage. Not all environments are open to everyone. 

The WE BUILD test environment (ITB) is handled independently of external test environments.

## Europe
The European Commission is establishing a Functional Conformance Assessment Framework (FCAF). This is a test suite aimed to support CABs (Conformance Assessment Bodies) in the certification of wallets and other ecosystem services.
* It does NOT provide a testing environment or actual testing options, only the specifications and definitions
* It is restricted to functional testing

Rough roadmap shows first functional stuff out in May (on PID issuing). From the Testing Group we'll monitor gaps and differences to testing in WE BUILD.

## France

Information from December 2025: We are releasing a specific 𝘀𝗮𝗻𝗱𝗯𝗼𝘅 𝗯𝘂𝗶𝗹𝗱 of France Identité, currently available on Android, to support early testing of 𝗣𝗜𝗗 𝗽𝗿𝗲𝘀𝗲𝗻𝘁𝗮𝘁𝗶𝗼𝗻, both in 𝗽𝗿𝗼𝘅𝗶𝗺𝗶𝘁𝘆 and 𝗼𝗻𝗹𝗶𝗻𝗲.
The iOS version will be released shortly.

This build is designed for hands-on experimentation: presenting a PID to real verifiers, exploring user journeys, and validating concrete end-to-end flows ahead of the 𝗘𝘂𝗿𝗼𝗽𝗲𝗮𝗻 𝗗𝗶𝗴𝗶𝘁𝗮𝗹 𝗜𝗱𝗲𝗻𝘁𝗶𝘁𝘆 𝗪𝗮𝗹𝗹𝗲𝘁 (𝗘𝗨𝗗𝗜𝗪) deployment.
What this sandbox build enables:
• 𝗣𝗜𝗗 𝗽𝗿𝗲𝘀𝗲𝗻𝘁𝗮𝘁𝗶𝗼𝗻 𝗶𝗻 𝗽𝗿𝗼𝘅𝗶𝗺𝗶𝘁𝘆 𝘀𝗰𝗲𝗻𝗮𝗿𝗶𝗼𝘀, following ISO 18013-5
• 𝗣𝗜𝗗 𝗽𝗿𝗲𝘀𝗲𝗻𝘁𝗮𝘁𝗶𝗼𝗻 𝗶𝗻 𝗿𝗲𝗺𝗼𝘁𝗲 𝗳𝗹𝗼𝘄𝘀, following ISO 18013-7 (Annex B)
We are actively working on adding 𝗺𝗼𝗿𝗲 𝗰𝗿𝗲𝗱𝗲𝗻𝘁𝗶𝗮𝗹𝘀 and 𝘀𝘂𝗽𝗽𝗼𝗿𝘁𝗲𝗱 𝗽𝗿𝗼𝘁𝗼𝗰𝗼𝗹𝘀 to progressively expand testing possibilities.

## Lithuania
Procivis has been awarded the contract to provide Lithuania’s EUDI Wallet sandbox. Working with SDSA, the State Digital Solutions Agency of Lithuania, Procivis will build
the national testbed to drive Lithuania’s digital identity activities and ensure readiness in advance of the EU-wide launch. 
The sandbox will enable testing of seamless digital identity verification for national and cross-border use cases including accessing public services, travel, and car rental. 

## Norway
The Norwegian department of digitalization (DigDir) has published a digital wallet sandbox

## Sweden
Sweden has a limited sandbox, which is currently undergoing fundamental reconstruction. We will provide information when it will become available again.
